# Themes

This folder holds files that change the look of the game's interface.

- **Palettes** set the colors.
- **Styles** control spacing and shape.

To use a different theme, copy a file from these folders and load it from inside the game.

To make your own theme:
1. Copy an existing file in `palettes` or `styles`.
2. Edit it with a text editor to change colors or sizes.
3. Save it with a new name and load it in the game.

Most players can simply pick one of the themes included here.
