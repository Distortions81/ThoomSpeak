goThoom Plugins
================

This folder holds plugin files. If you just want to play, you can ignore it.

### Using a plugin
1. Copy a `.go` plugin file here or beside the game program.
2. Restart the game and the plugin will load automatically.
3. Any hotkeys or commands added by the plugin appear in the "Plugin Hotkeys" window.

The `example_*.go` files show what plugins can do. Open them in a text editor to learn more.

Writing new plugins requires Go programming knowledge and is not covered here.
