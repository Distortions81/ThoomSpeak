goThoom Plugins
================

This folder shows sample add-ons for goThoom.
If you only want to play, you can ignore it.

### Using a plugin
1. Copy a `.go` plugin file into this `plugins` folder or beside the game program.
2. Restart the game and the plugin will load automatically.
3. Any hotkeys or commands added by the plugin appear in the "Plugin Hotkeys" window.

The files here demonstrate what plugins can do. Open them in a text editor to learn more.

Creating your own plugins requires Go programming knowledge and is beyond this guide.
